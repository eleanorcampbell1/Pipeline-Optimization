# Pipeline-Optimization
Improving performance of pipeline y86 program.

Implemented using Assembly code for UBC CPSC 313 y86 architecture, which is similar to the x8086 architecture. <br />


Number of clock cycles taken on 'Pipelined with stalling' implementation reduced by 86%. <br />
Number of clock cycles taken on 'Pipelined with data forwarding and branch prediction' implementation reduced by 75%.
